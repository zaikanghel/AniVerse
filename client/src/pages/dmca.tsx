        <h2>1. Reporting Copyright Infringement</h2>
        <p>
          If you believe that content available on or through AnimeVerse's services infringes one or more of your copyrights, 
          please submit a written notification ("DMCA Notice") containing the following information:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive 
            right that is allegedly infringed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are 
            covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity 
            and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to 
            permit us to locate the material.
          </li>
          <li>
            Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and,

          </li>
          <li>
            A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not 
            authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
          </li>
          <li>
            A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are 
            authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
          </li>
        </ol>
